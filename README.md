This folder contains the Simple Shell project for the ALX SE Program. In this project, a program is developed to duplicate the properties and functionalities of a basic UNIX shell using the C programming language. To use the program, simply compile all the .c files in this folder like this:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o [exe file name]

The program will be ready to execute, and the user can run it to execute simple Shell instructions, and run other executeable files.
